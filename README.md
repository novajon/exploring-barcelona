* Barcelona Exploration *

I recently moved to Barcelona so now I want to explore the city. Apart from the obvious touristic highlights, to me that is about learning from the data. Therefore, I created this repo to perform some basic data analysis on the open datasets provided by the city of Barcelona and its Open Data initiative.
